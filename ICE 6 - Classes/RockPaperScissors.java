 * App Name: Fibonacci Sequence
 * Description: This application is designed to prompt the user to input a number that will be used to determine
 * a index range to calculate the fibonacci sequence until. This sequence is used within this application through the 
 * implentation of recursion - within the askforMax() function. Recursion here functions by calling a method
 * within itself, which in this case if the user does not enter a number that passes validation then the method
 * will call itself recursively until the input is valid.
